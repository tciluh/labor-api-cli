name: Test Protocol
description: This is a test protocol
instructions:
    - Add the description of step one here:
        actions:
            - photometer:  # the name of the corresponding plugin in labor-api (required)
                action: measure #each plugin supports certain actions (required)
                equationIdentifier: a #each action can define a optional identifier with which it can be referenced in an equation instruction
                wavelength: 420 # this will be passed to the plugin as well as anything which is defined here
                current: 1 # use this to pass arguments to the plugin
        results:
            - add a description for a result here: #for singular result (i.e. instructions that directly to another instruction) these will probably not be displayed by the client
                nextInstruction: 1 #the index of the next instruction. indizes start at zero, so this would be instruction 0.
    - Add a description for the second step here:
        results:
            - Wow we did something:
                nextInstruction: 2
    - Add a description for the third step here:
        results:  # steps can have multiple results like this
            - Something turned green:  #use the result description to describe the criteria which should lead to the selection of this step by the user
                nextInstruction: 3 # each result will have a different next instruction. this one references the instruction at index 3 (aka the fourth instruction defined)
            - Something turned yellow: # the user will be presented with both result descriptions. he will then have to choose one, so make sure these are unique
                nextInstruction: 4
    - Add a description for variant a of step 4:
        results:
            - Something happened here:
                nextInstruction: 5 # multiple instruction can have the same target instructions. this makes it easy to have a user perform additional steps before continuing with the normal protocol.
    - add a description for variant b of step 4:
        results:
            - Something else happened here:
                nextInstruction: 5 # multiple instruction can have the same target instructions. this makes it easy to have a user perform additional steps before continuing with the normal protocol.
    - add a description for the final step here: #instructions which have a result without a nextInstruction will be considered a final instruction by the client
        equation: "a + b * 2" # sometimes you'd probably like to display a calculated value at the end of a protocol. use recorded measurements here via their equation identifier.
        results:
            - experiment finished:
                nextInstruction: null
