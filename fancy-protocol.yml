name: Fancy Test Protocol
description: This is a test protocol with pictures
instructions: 
    - Step 1:
        description: Always wear gloves!
        imagePath: fancy/Step 1.png
        actions:
            - photometer:  # the name of the corresponding plugin in labor-api (required)
                action: measure #each plugin supports certain actions (required)
                equationIdentifier: a #each action can define a optional identifier with which it can be referenced in an equation instruction
                wavelength: 420 # this will be passed to the plugin as well as anything which is defined here
                current: 1 # use this to pass arguments to the plugin
        results:
            - add a description for a result here: Step 2 #for singular result (i.e. instructions that directly to another instruction) these will probably not be displayed by the client
    - Step 2:
        description: Put something in
        imagePath: fancy/Step 2.png
        results:
            - Something was put in: Step 3
    - Step 3:
        description: Wait for 60 seconds
        timerDuration: 60 # this step will show the user a timer which runs for 60 seconds
        # equation: "a*b*c" # note that a step can either contain a equation or a timer duration otherwise protocol insertion will fail
        results:
            - We waited for 60 secs: Step 4
    - Step 4:
        description: Check for cloudiness of your sample
        imagePath: fancy/Step 4.png
        results:  # steps can have multiple results like this
            - description: The sample is cloudy:  #use the result description to describe the criteria which should lead to the selection of this step by the user
              imagePath: fancy/Step 4r0.png
              nextInstruction: Step 5a
            - description: The sample is not cloudy
              imagePath: fancy/Step 4r1.png
              nextInstruction: Step 5b

    - Step 5a:
        description: Add some silicone
        imagePath: fancy/Step 5a.png
        results:
            - We added some silicone: Step 6
    - Step 5b:
        description: Add something that is not silicone please!
        imagePath: fancy/Step 5b.png
        results:
            - We added something that did not contain silicone: Step 6
    - Step 6: 
        description: Yeah you are done with this protocol. Enjoy this fancy equation x) 
        imagePath: fancy/Step 6.png
        equation: "\"Brightness\" = a + b * 2" # sometimes you'd probably like to display a calculated value at the end of a protocol. use recorded measurements here via their equation identifier.
        results:
            - experiment finished: null
