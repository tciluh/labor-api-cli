name: Determination of free amino nitrogen in beer (EBC)
description: This method implies to determine the free amino nitrogen (FAN) in beer, which includes amino acids, ammonia and end group amino nitrogens. The free amino nitrogen content (FAN) of a finished beer reflects primarily the utilization of wort free amino nitrogen during fermentation. Typical values for the FAN in beer lie between 10 and 120 mg/L. The detection and quantification of alpha-amino acids can be accomplished by the ninhydrin reaction. Ninhydrin is an oxidizing agent, which causes the oxidative decarboxylation of amino acids that results in an elimination of  CO2, NH3 and a formation of an aldehyde which is one carbon atom shorter than the initial amino acid. Reduced and unreduced ninhydrin reacts with free NH3 to a blue or yellow dye (in a reaction with proline). Fructose acts as an reducing agent within the reaction. Potassium iodate within the dilution solution acts keeps the ninhydrin oxidized and prevents undesired secondary reactions. The sample solutions get heated and the resulting dye can be measured at 570 nm.
