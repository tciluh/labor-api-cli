name: Determination of total carbohydrates in beer
description: The determination of carbohydrates in beer is an important method for the characterization of beer samples. The amount of carbohydrates is especially important for diabetics and people that want to decrease the amount of carbohydrates in their nutrition. Whereas conventional beers have a carbohydrate amount of over 3 %, it is legally defined that diet beers are only allowed to have a carbohydrate amount of 0.75 %. Carbohydrates get hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid and dehydrated. The resulting 5-Hydroxyfurfural reacts with Anthrone to a bluish green dye, which can be measured at 625 nm.
