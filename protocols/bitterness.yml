name: Determination of bitter units in beer (EBC)
description: Bitter compounds determine the characteristic bitter taste of beer. Important bitter compounds in beer are iso-alpha-acids. Other bitter compounds in beer are the beta-acids as well as the delta-acids. Derivatives of hop bitter acids, especially their oxidation products, contribute to the bitter taste. The bitter compounds, mainly iso-alpha-acids, will be extracted from acidified sample and the concentration will be determined via spectrophotometric measurement at 275 nm. The bitter units (EBC) can afterwards be calculated by using the appropriate equation.
