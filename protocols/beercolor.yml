name: Beer color determination
description: This method implies to eliminate subjective influences of the human eye as well as differences in the color impression with the comparison of beer samples with a color card (MEBAK  2.12.1). The extinction of a diluted beer sample is measured in a 10-mm-cuvette at a wavelength of 430 nm. Melanoides and Melanoidines that are formed in the brewing process absorb at 430 nm. The color in EBC units can be calculated by using an appropriate factor.
